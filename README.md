# Bogo-Sort-Hello-World
This program is mainly just a test for C#, which bogo sorts all of the letter combinations which *could* equal "hello world" as an executable file.

I originally wrote this program in java but I wanted something to test out C#, and I thought Id just recreate this. Im not posting the java version
because its not really that cool, plus this ones an executable file, so its cooler.
